  ## Description

  A handy Node.js-based tool that allows users to easily generate a stylized index.html based on their team of employees, which may be comprised of generic employees, managers, engineers, and interns.
  
  ## Installation

  - Ensure that Node.js is installed on your local machine
  - Clone the GitHub repo to your local machine
  - Use your local machine's command-line to navigate to the cloned repo's directory
  - Run "npm install"
  - Run "node index.js"

  ## Usage

  Using this command-line application, a user may easily generate a webpage containing information on the user's team of employees. A user may answer a series of questions, powered by Inquirer, to generate an index.html and corresponding style.css. The contents of the index.html depends on how the user answers the prompts within the command-line--the user is prompted to fill in an employee's name, email address, and ID number. Afterwards, the user is asked if the employee is a Manager, Engineer, or Intern, after which the user is prompted to input the employee's office number, GitHub username, and school, respectively. Once the user completes the required information for a given employee, the user may then add a new employee by being prompted with a Y/n question. Once the user adds all the employees they wish, the command-line informs the user that their brand new index.html and style.css is generated, after which the user may do with their generated files as they see fit.
